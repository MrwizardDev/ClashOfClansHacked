Keep in mind that using this script may violate the Clash of Clans terms of service and could get your account banned. Use it at your own risk.

Also, note that this script assumes that the Clash of Clans DLL has an exported function called SetGemCount that takes one integer parameter. The actual function name and parameter may vary depending on the version of the game and the DLL.

Remember, cheating in Clash of Clans is against the game's terms of service and can result in account suspension or even ban. Use this script at your own risk.
